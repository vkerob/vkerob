# Hey there, I'm VKerob 👋

📍 **France** • 🎓 **42 student with an interest in Cybersecurity & Networking**

I'm passionate about cybersecurity, networking, and low-level programming.  
I build educational projects focusing on reverse engineering, malware analysis, infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes), and Linux internals.  
I like breaking things down to understand how they really work — from memory to packets to processes.

## 🔧 What I'm about

I studied system-level programming and networking at 42 Angoulême, where I completed the **common core** — the first part of the curriculum.  
During that phase, I worked on projects like building a custom shell (`minishell`), reimplementing standard functions (`libft`, `ft_printf`, `get_next_line`), and writing a small 3D engine (`cub3d`).

In the **advanced part of the program**, I chose to go deeper into system internals and infrastructure. I reimplemented `malloc`, explored assembly (`libasm`), audited a vulnerable website (`darkly`), and built my own Kubernetes pipeline (`Inception-of-Things`).  
I've also done personal networking projects, like simulating a **Man-in-the-Middle attack** using Docker containers.

What drives me is understanding how things work at low level — memory, syscalls, networking, containers...  
Now, I’m preparing to dive into **reverse engineering**, and I plan to try platforms like **RootMe** to sharpen my cybersecurity skills even further.

## 🚩 Featured Projects

- [**FT-NM**](https://github.com/vkerob/ft_nm): Custom Linux `nm` implementation in C.
- [**Malloc**](https://github.com/vkerob/malloc): Custom memory allocator (malloc).
- [**Inception-of-Things**](https://github.com/vkerob/Inception-of-Things): DevOps automation with Kubernetes, Docker, Argo CD.
- MITM Network Lab: Docker-based MITM attack simulation (private access available upon request).

## 📚 Learning Path & Objectives

- Developing my skills in low-level networking by reimplementing tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nmap` in C.
- Preparing to dive into reverse engineering (ELF structure, disassembly, etc.).
- Exploring malware creation from a technical and educational perspective, in a safe and controlled environment.
- Planning to start Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms like RootMe to test my knowledge in real-world scenarios.
